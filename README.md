**You can find an example in the usage_example.py**
### steps:
1. Navigate to either the Classifier.py, Detector.py or segmenter.py and fill in the make model function    
2. Make an external file where you make an instance of the encoder and one of the following according to your task (classifier,detector, segmenter)
3. Call the ```ModelBlock.add_head(encoder, [classifier])``` to add your model head to the encoder
